# Plane-Project
This project "simulates" the operations of a Plane (e.g. adding gas, landing, flying, etc.) using a Plane class and various class member methods. It also implements a TestPlane class to check if the operations are performed as intended.

This project was created for coursework at GRCC for Computer Science II.
