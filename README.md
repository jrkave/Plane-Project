## Features
1. **Plane Attributes**: defines basic plane attributes such as capacity, speed, and fuel level
2. **Operations**: functions to perform various operations like flying the plane, refueling, and changing the speed
3. **Data Retrieval**: retrieve the current status of the plane, including its speed and the amount of fuel left

## Installation
To clone and use this project locally, use the following command: `git clone https://github.com/jrkave/Plane-Project.git`

## Usage
Open the project in your preferred IDE and run the Plane.java file to initialize a plane object and manipulate its properties through method calls. You can customize the program to create multiple plane objects and control their attributes dynamically.

## Code Overview
Plane.java: This file contains the Plane class which encapsulates the attributes and methods necessary to create and manipulate a plane object. It includes methods to fly the plane, change its speed, refuel, and retrieve the current status of the plane.
